# geoapi
A Python based REST API for geospatial data
## A Python based REST API for Geospatial Data
This project creates a modern, high performance REST API using GIS data from a PostGres/PostGIS database.  It is based on the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com" target="_blank">FastAPI</a> web framework and uses Python 3.6+

## Major Technologies & Frameworks
- Python
- FastAPI
- Postgres
- PostGIS

## Major Python Libraries
Details in ./requirements.txt:
- GeoAlchemy2/SQLAlchemy/Shapely/geojson
- asyncpg/databases
- aiofiles/aiohttp
- uvicorn/uvloop/starlette/FastAPI
- Pillow
- mypy/pylint/Pydantic/yapf/absl-py

## Using the API
### Setup
- Install docker, docker-compose and git
- Clone this git repository

### Startup
cd to the repo **./dist** folder, run:

```Shell
docker-compose up -d
```  
This will start the following:
- A PostgreSQL database needed by the REST API.  The database server is exposed on port 5556 (can be changed in the docker-compose.yml file)
- A REST API that connects to this database.  The REST API is exposed on port 8001 (can be changed in the docker-compose.yml file)
- The REST API will then be available at http://localhost:8001 
- The REST API endpoints are documented at http://localhost:8001/docs which shows the Swagger UI and links to the OpenAPI spec for the API

## Running the API
The REST API is accessible at http://localhost:8001 and provides the following endpoints (documented with examples at http://localhost:8001/docs):
- http://localhost:8001/properties/{property_id}/display/ - gets a jpg image of the property given it's property id and saves a geotiff image in the geoapi/static/tmp folder)
- http://localhost:8001/properties/{property_id}/statistics/ - gets a statistics json object for data near a property given it's property id and a search distance in meters
- http://localhost:8001/properties/{property_id}/ - get a json object for a property (including geojson for geography fields), given the property_id
- http://localhost:8001/properties/ - get a list of json objects for all properties
- http://localhost:8001/properties/find/ - (POST) - post a geojson geometry and a search distance in meters, returns a list of property ids within the search distance to the input geometry
- http://localhost:8001/properties/ - (POST) - post a json object to insert a new property into the database (with geojson for geography fields), returns the new property as a json object.

## Development
The following instructions assume development on Mac or Linux:
- Install docker, docker-compose, git and Python 3.6+
- Clone this git repository
- cd to the repo root - **geoapi**, create a python virtual environment, activate it, upgrade pip and install python dependencies:

```Shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Insure a database container is setup and available on the localhost.  Look at ./src/docker-compose.yml for setting up a database container for development
- Create an environment variable called DATABASE_URL with the database connection string
- Make initial changes to the code in the src folder:
  - in the ./src/geoapi/main.py file, uncomment the line: `app = create_app()`.  This is needed since reload from within main is broken due to a bug in uvicorn
  - while the virtual environment is active, cd to the ./src folder and run:

```Shell
uvicorn geoapi.main:app --reload
```
- Now make changes to the code under the ./src folder
- Once finished, make sure to update ./requirements.txt, if any new python packages have been installed
- Make sure to comment out the line: `app = create_app()` in the ./src/geoapi/main.py file
- Run `./build.sh`. This simple script copies all required files to the `./dist` folder, replacing what may have previously existed in the ./dist folder.  ./build.sh may need to be modified if new files are added that are not getting copied to the ./dist folder
- Commit the code to git
- Rebuild the docker image and push it to the image repository
