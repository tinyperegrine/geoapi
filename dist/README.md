# geoapi
A Python based REST API for geospatial data
## A Python based REST API for Geospatial Data
This project creates a modern, high performance REST API using GIS data from a PostGres/PostGIS database.  It is based on the <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com" target="_blank">FastAPI</a> web framework and uses Python 3.6+

## Major Technologies & Frameworks
- Python
- FastAPI
- Postgres
- PostGIS

## Major Python Libraries
Details in requirements.txt:
- GeoAlchemy2/SQLAlchemy/Shapely/geojson
- asyncpg/databases
- aiofiles/aiohttp
- uvicorn/uvloop/starlette/FastAPI
- Pillow
- mypy/pylint/Pydantic/yapf/absl-py

## Setup
### Development
- Install docker, docker-compose and git
- Clone this git repository
- Make changes to the code in the src folder
- Run `build.sh`. This simple script copies all required files from the `src` folder to the `dist` folder, replacing what may have previously existed in the dist folder.  Build.sh may need to be modified if new files are added that are not getting copied to the dist folder

### Application Startup
From the repo dist folder, run:

```Shell
docker-compose up -d
```  
This will start the following:
- It will start the PostgreSQL database needed by the REST API.  The database server is exposed on port 5556 (the port can be changed in the docker-compose.yml file)
- It will start the REST API that connects to this database.  The REST API is exposed on port 8001 (the port can be changed in the docker-compose.yml file)
- The REST API will then be available at http://localhost:8001 
- The REST API endpoints are documented at http://localhost:8001/docs which shows the Swagger UI and links to the OpenAPI spec for the api 

## Using the REST API
The REST API is accessible at http://localhost:8001 and provides the following endpoints (documented with examples at http://localhost:8001/docs):
- http://localhost:8001/properties/{property_id}/display/ - gets a jpg image of the property given it's property id and saves a geotiff image in the geoapi/static/tmp folder)
- http://localhost:8001/properties/{property_id}/statistics/ - gets a statistics json object for data near a property given it's property id and a search distance in meters
- http://localhost:8001/properties/{property_id}/ - get a json object for a property (including geojson for geography fields), given the property_id
- http://localhost:8001/properties/ - get a list of json objects for all properties
- http://localhost:8001/properties/find/ - (POST) - post a geojson geometry and a search distance in meters, returns a list of property ids within the search distance to the input geometry
- http://localhost:8001/properties/ - (POST) - post a json object to insert a new property into the database (with geojson for geography fields), returns the new property as a json object.

## Restoring from Archive and Reload during Development
- To Archive: cd to src and archive with:

        ```Shell
        git archive -o geapi1.zip --prefix=geoapi/ HEAD
        ```
To Restore:
- cd to src, then unzip
For Reload During Development:
- expose the `app` variable in `main.py` globally by uncommenting: `app = create_app()` (since reload from within main is broken due to a bug in uvicorn)
- then run: 
        
        ```Shell
        uvicorn geoapi.main:app --reload
        ```

## Regular Use during Development:
- cd to `geoapi` (assumes development with a virtual environment called `venv` and assumes use of Visual Studio Code) and run:
        
        ```Shell
        source venv/bin/activate
        code .
        ```

- cd to `src`, uncomment the line: `app = create_app()` in `main.py`, then run:
        
        ```Shell
        uvicorn geoapi.main:app --reload
        code .
        ```

## Docker related Deployment:
**Production deployment:**
- comment out the line: `app = create_app()` in `main.py`
- commit to git
- run:

```Shell
source ./build.sh
```

**Running containers** (from `src` or `dist` folders and when rebuilding image):

```Shell
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
```

**Pushing new image:**
(docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname)

```Shell
docker login
docker tag image_id tinyperegrine/geoapi:1.0
docker push tinyperegrine/geoapi:1.0
```
